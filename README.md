# Faculty-leave-application-portal
The current system for a faculty member to apply for a leave is tedious and time consuming. 
It  includes  a  lot of undesirable paper work and goes through several hierarchical steps, 
right from application  to   approval.  In  an   attempt to avoid this, our team proposed a 
solution: A web based application for  faculty   leave management. This application enables 
individual faculty members to apply for a particular type of leave and allows them to provide 
substitute arrangement.
